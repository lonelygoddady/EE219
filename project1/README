In this project we use python Scikit.Sklearn library to do regression analysis on network backup file datasheets and Boston real estate priceing data sheets.

On these two datasets, we performed following regression analysis:
1.  Linear regression
2.  Polynomial Regression 
3.  Random Forest model
4.  Neural network model
5.  Lasso and ridge regression 

In order to compile our code, please enter the 'Code' folder and run main.py file.
Regression function definition is written in the help.py file which main.py file will import from. 

To view the regression Analysis result, please enter the Graph directory.

Please refor to the 'Report' file for complete project report
